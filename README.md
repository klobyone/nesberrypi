This is just me attempting to have fun and learn about with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) - something I spent a lot of time using in my childhood. 
I figured the Raspberry Pi was the perfect way for me to do some tinkering.

My original goal was to write the simplest program I could in C to read input from a controller using the BCM2835 libraries. The second part of that goal was to do without seeking out other projects that attempted to do the same so I could learn something. I obtained the knowledge I needed to write the code from [here](http://www.mit.edu/~tarvizo/nes-controller.html).
